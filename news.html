        While the OpenSCAD account on Twitter is not the most active one, it still was a nice
        place to see what people are designing and sharing. But with Twitter now moving into
        strange directions with surprising similarities to the freenode desaster like
        <a href="https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/social-platforms-policy">banning
        links to other social media sites</a> we have removed the freshly added link to

      </p>
      <p>
        So here are the links to the 2 offical accounts that are currently active:

          OpenSCAD, in collaboration with <a href="http://brlcad.org/">BRL-CAD</a>, has again been accepted
          to <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/">Google Summer of Code</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
          This years <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/programs/2022/projects/erQ53gJD">GSoC project</a>
          titled "3D Viewport Graphical Enhancements" is meant to modernize part of the display
          code and give some support for nicer model presentation.
        </p>
        <br clear="all">
        <p><b>Abstract:</b></p>
        <p>
          The project would allow the 3D viewport to support custom shaders for the render mode (F6).
          This requires retrieving the necessary uniforms and other shader input/outputs, then providing
          them to the program. Moreover, currently the GUI does not have options to allow the user to
          manage which shader is used, or add their own. The project would add these interface options to
          support shader management for the render by the user. Additionally, a set of default shaders
          could be included which the user could switch between.

      <h1 class="title">New Online Customizer Works with Thingiverse</h1>
      <h2 class="date">20 Feb 2022</h2>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>
          <h3>Guest post introducing MakeWithTech</h3>
        </p>
        <img class="newsimg" src="images/makewithtech-icon.svg" title="MakeWithTech"/>
        <p>
          If you're into 3D printing, you know that Thingiverse<sup>1</sup>
          is an excellent place to find models to print. Unfortunately, the customizer
          on Thingiverse has been broken for a long time.
          <a href="https://makewithtech.com">MakeWithTech</a>
          just released a new online service that allows you to customize OpenSCAD
          models. Browse models @ Thingiverse, select them for customization or upload
          them from your desktop, customize and queue for rendering. The
          <a href="https://models.makewithtech.com/">models.makewithtech.com</a>
          infrastructure supports hundreds of simultaneous renders using the genuine
          OpenSCAD software. Learn more by watching this
          <a href="https://youtu.be/j58XA3kB8CI">YouTube video</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          For many experienced users of OpenSCAD, this application is unnecessary.
          However, an online option is valuable for thousands of 3d printer users with
          no CAD or programming experience. Providing a web-based customizer that hides
          the OpenSCAD script creates an opportunity to develop a robust marketplace for
          OpenSCAD based designs.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a beta, I am looking for input on features, reports of bugs, and thoughts
          about how a robust OpenSCAD marketplace would be structured. You can leave bug
          reports and feature suggestions right on
          <a href="https://models.makewithtech.com/">the site</a>
          via the link in the footer.

            Experimenting with the OpenSCAD language, <a href="https://www.sol75.com/">SOL75</a>
            offers an online customizer where the inputs are the desired performances of a component.
            The software then finds a suitable value for each of the component parameters, modifying
            its geometry to make it compliant with the requested performances.
            This allows for example to directly specify the maximum mass for a part, or the mechanical
            load it shall support.
        </p>
        <p>
            The project is geared toward functional mechanical parts, with built-in support for common 
            printing materials, customizable printer configurations and dynamically generated documentation 
            based on component requirements. You can have a look at <a href="https://www.sol75.com/">SOL75 landing page</a>

      <h1 class="title">OpenSCAD 2021.01 released</h1>
      <h2 class="date">31 January 2021</h2>
      <div class="entry">
        <p>Even though the development cycle was a bit shorter than last time, it's still
        been almost 2 years and this has collected quite a long list of new features and
        bugixes for this release.</p>

        <p>The big language change is the introduction of
        <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/User-Defined_Functions_and_Modules#Function_Literals">function
        literals</a> but there are a number of other useful changes too, like the
        new exponent operator (<code>^</code>) and much better and more general support for tail
        recursion optimization.</p>

        <p>The GUI and especially the Editor has seen a huge amount of new features. Most
        visible is probably the auto-complete which can propose built-in functions and
        modules.</p>

        <p>Another much anticipated feature is the "jump to code" from the 3d preview.
        While it's not possible to go into the deepest levels of the design in all cases,
        it's a great tool to navigate designs.</p>

        <p>But it's worth highlighting also some of the not so obvious smaller features which
        might improve the editing workflow.
        <ul>
          <li><i>Bookmarks</i> - Ctrl+F2 to toogle bookmarks, F2 / Shift+F2 for jumping to next/previous bookmark.</li>
          <li><i>Changing numbers via mouse</i> - Similar to ALT+Cursor-Up/Down, numbers can be modified by placing the cursor at the number and using the mouse scroll wheel while pressing the ALT key.</li>
          <li><i>Code snippets</i> - Insert often used code snippets using ALT+Insert or via editor context menu, custom templates can be added as simple files.</li>
        </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Thanks to everyone who has contributed to this release through development
        and community management, bug reports and fixes, documentation, translation,
        discussions, as well as testing the release candidates!</p>

        <p>A special <i>thank you</i> goes to the Google Summer of Code students who have
        joined the OpenSCAD team for a couple of month and have helped to make some of those
        new features possible (details on those projects can be found in the
        <a href="https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues?q=label%3A%22Tag%3A+GSoC%22">project reports</a>
        on github). It's been a nice time and an opportunity learn and disucss ideas.</p>

        <p>The source code, as well as binaries for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux are ready
        for <a href="downloads.html">download</a>.</p>

                    <p>After a quiet summer, there's now progress integrating a number of features
                    that were cooking in development branches for quite some time.</p>
                    <br clear="all"/>
                    <dl>
                    <dt>3D-Mouse support</dt>
                    <dd>Even though the initial effort was to support 3D-Mouse devices, specifically
                    the relatively affordable range of SpaceMouse/SpaceNavigator products from
                    3Dconnexion, OpenSCAD will support various input devices (e.g. Joysticks and
                    and Gamepads) depending on the platform it's running on.<br>
                    The preferences dialog allows configuration of the behavior of the input devices
                    regarding control of the 3D viewport and mapping buttons to user interface
                    actions.</dd>
                    <dt>Customizer</dt>
                    <dd>Inspired by the Thingiverse Customizer, this will allow customizing designs
                    via a simple user interface and save sets of parameter presets.
		    While this feature has been available in the development snapshots for
                    a while now, there were lots of improvements lately to both usability of the
                    interface as well as correctly handling of parameters hints specfied in the
                    model source code.</dd>
                    <dt>3MF Import/Export</dt>
                    <dd>The 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF) as defined by the <a href="https://3mf.io/">
                    3MF Consortium</a> is one of the contenders to take over from STL. With
                    support for extended features like colors, materials, properties, multiple
                    volumes and the possibility to extend with both public and private features,
                    it's much more versatile than the (for 3d printing) commonly used STL format.
                    As additional reason for this format being a very attractive option is that
                    its <a href=https://3mf.io/specification/">Specification</a> and
                    <a href="https://github.com/3MFConsortium/lib3mf/">reference implementation</a>
                    are freely available and useable in Open Source projects.</dd>
                    </dl>
		    <br clear="all"/>
		    <p>At this point all of the features are available in the latest development
		    snapshots but are still marked as <i>experimental</i> which means they need
		    to be specifically enabled in the preferences dialog.</p>

                      <p>The topic of this year's Google Summer of Code project is <i>customization</i>. This is a small mid-term update on the status of this project.</p>
                      
                      <p>One of the primary benefits of OpenSCAD is the ability to design <i>customizable</i> content. These are designs which are parametrized using parameters or top-level variables.</p>

                    <p>Some projects utilize OpenSCAD's ability to customize designs as part of their web services, e.g. <a href="http://customizer.makerbot.com/docs">Thingiverse Customizer</a>, <a href="https://www.sculpteo.com/fr/developer/webapi/create/openscad/">Sculpteo Parametric Designs</a> and <a href="http://enablingthefuture.org/handomatic/">e-NABLE Handomatic</a>.</p>

                    <p>The goal of this project is two-fold, 1) offer an auto-generated GUI associated with a customizable design, making it easier to both create and use such designs and 2) offer an authoritative standard for how to specify meta-data to guide the generation of such a GUI. As a temporary measure, we're also planning to support the meta-data syntax used by Thingiverse, making it possible to use the thousands of customizable designs published there.</p>

                    <p>Want to learn more, or download development binaries for Mac or Windows? Our GSoC developer, Amarjeet Kapoor, has written a blog post detailing the state of the project: <a href="https://amarjeetkapoor1.wordpress.com/2016/07/04/user-interface-for-customizing-models/">User Interface for Customizing Models</a>.</p>

                    <p>We're also interested in your opinions on this. Feel free to reach out on the <a href="community.html#mailing-list">mailing list</a> or <a href="community.html#irc">#openscad on IRC</a>.

				<ul>
					<li>use'ing an non-existing file sometimes crashed under Windows</li>
					<li>Better font handling: Ensure a monospace font is chosen as default</li>

					<li>Larger minkowski operations sometimes caused a crash after a CGAL assert was thrown</li>
					<li>Fixed crashes in shared_ptr.hpp (or similar places) due bugs in cache management and CSG normalization</li>

			<h1 class="title">OpenSCAD release: 2011.12</h1>
			<h2 class="date">29 Dec 2011</h2>
			<div class="entry">
			  <p>I've just released OpenSCAD 2011.12. The source package as well as the Mac OS X binaries can be downloaded from <a href="https://openscad.org">openscad.org</a>. Binaries for Linux and Windows will appear when the package managers get them built and tested.</p>
			  <p>This release of OpenSCAD has taken a lot of time to get out the door, primarily due to the backend being refactored to facilitate further development and the introduction of a regression test framework. The combination of these should make it possible to do more rapid releases in the future.</p>
			  <p>Thanks a lot to all contributors!</p>
				<p>Have fun,<br />-Marius</p>
